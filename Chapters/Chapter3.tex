\chapter{Experimental Configuration and Preliminaries}
\label{Chapter3} 

This chapter provides a unified description of the uniformity of all the experimental environments, datasets, evaluation metrics, and baselines selected for your papers. If your research is based on the same dataset, you can, like me, dedicate a separate chapter to them. Otherwise, you can also write a preliminary description for each of the proposals you have made (each proposal corresponds to one of the methods below).
